      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated in May 2021 from the University of Minnesota with a BS in Psychology and minor in Public Health.
        I am well versed in remote work and accumulating experience in the human resources sector for a tech company.
        While working with people is my strong suit, I am interested in computer programming and hoping to find a developer role.</p>

      <h3>Languages</h3>
      <p>
        I started teaching myself a few coding languages after graduating from college.
        Since then, I have taken intro-level courses in Java and JavaScript through Codecademy.
        Most of my focus has gone into an advanced <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn">python course on Udemy.</a>
        Through this course, I also learned enough about HTML and CSS to create this website.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/haileyrs/sheetly-workouts">Sheetly Workouts</a></h3>
        <p>
          This program takes user input and sends it to the Nutritionix natural language API.
          Specific words relating to the exercise performed and duration are pulled and put into a .json() file.
          The exercise type, duration, and calories burned are posted to a GoogleSheet using the Sheetly API.
          This program makes logging exercise more appealing my minimizing effort needed to log workouts.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/haileyrs/personal-site">This Website</a></h3>
        <p>
          This page was developed using HTML and CSS.
          It implements images, links, as well as a handy 'contact me' button at the bottom.
          The entire website was built one day afer I learned that CSS existed.
